Other comments:
- libgcrypt was compiled with --disable-asm and --disable-padlock-support flags
- the ssize_t typedef was commented out in gcrypt.h; we define it elsewhere
- lib/*.dll.a files were moved to bin/*.lib (including a version number based on the lib/*.dll file)
- the .dll files were stripped (strip bin/*.dll)
